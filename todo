Next:

    Consider to split:
                    make_move(..., just_move/take_back, ...);
                into:
                    make_move(...);  and  take_back(...);


    Create a return path for 'no new move found'.

    Create Got_it()
        Rename bingo back  got_it.
        print.
        stop.

    Try a few primitive real setups.


    Revise this todo list


    Next:

    Create list of start positons for backward search.

    Create stop condifiotn (program stops) when 'no new move found'. (Forward and backward differ here.)




    Remove dead backward seard trees.

    Prune dead branches.
    - Save time for subsequent tree walks
    - Could also be used to reuse the memory blocks.
    This is similar to pruning dead backward trees, but more difficult. It requires tracking of
    "no new moves found" at the move node level, rather than at the move root level.



    Keep track of distance, and replace existing moves by moves on the same level but with shorter distance, considering
    a setup a simple as:

            #####
        #####   #
        #.X.OX  #
        #########       (setup-test 27)



    Add nogos for dead-end lanes:
            #####
        ##### . #
        #       #
        ####    #
           #    #
           ######




    Document headers for functions. Might decrease heavy comments.

    Use more exit() calls and clean up code.
        At least do it for allocate_memory()

    Bring documentation up to date.

    Double check: Test for the maximum value of the index before returning a new tree memblock.

    Double check the conditions for new_hardnogos in the linescanner.

    Document why this impl uses indexed arrays and not pointers. (Jeopardising type safety.)

    Change and document file structure:
        - Create blockers.c
            Move define_hardnogos there.

    Print large setup: change to 3-digit numbers; similar to medium setup

Later:
    Find blockers in run time.
        Start with doubles:

            #X      Or:     #X
            #X              X#

        Next is squares.

            XX      Or:     #X
            XX              XX

    Compile with optimisation for speed.

    Malloc the playing grounds (instead of static 50*50.) ?
