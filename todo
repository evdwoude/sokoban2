Next:
    Document headers for functions in position.c. Might decrease heavy comments.

    Use more exit() calls and clean up code.

    Todo:
        Document latest changes
        Test for the maximum value of the index before returning a new tree memblock.
        Double check the dependencies.

    Return values of functions:
            A function primarily returns the intrinsic result.
            If an error conditon is a potential outcome:
                - Embed the errror condition in the function result
                - Where ever that is not feasible, use a sepate return variable for the error.

    Implement
        utility.c
            struct position_node *new_position_node(p_game_data_t p_game_data);

        position.c
            explore for identifier

            skbn_err add_position(p_game_data_t p_game_data, p_spot johnny)

    Double check the conditions for new_hardnogos in the linescanner.

    Document why this impl uses indexed arrays and not pointers. (Violating type safety.)

    Change and document file structure:
        - Create blockers.c
            Move define_hardnogos there.

    Print large setup: change to 3-digit numbers; similar to medium setup

    Create defined for move_data manipulations.

    Implement the forward walk_to_extend_depth






Later:
    Find blockers in run time.
        Start with doubles:

            #X      Or:     #X
            #X              X#

        Next is squares.

            XX      Or:     #X
            XX              XX

    Try to generalise the code for Fw and BW search.
    If not: Separate fw and bw in separate files (Try using the same function names, with static.)

    Compile with optimisation for speed.

    Malloc the playing grounds (instead of static 50*50.)

    Add hardnogos / reduce position nodes:
    Add spots that can never be populated by a box because, a: it impossible to do so when it is
    adjecent to only walls and/or hardnogos, and b: there is no box on it as per setup.
