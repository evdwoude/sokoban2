Next:
    Test optimisation: balanced FW/BW based on counted tree width, (count new extentions only).

    In solution.c,
        Double check find_path() and print_path().
        Find better function names for find_path and print_path.

        In print_steps() combine the nested if's ?

        Split print_single() into print_step() and print_move().

    Review init_move_tree().

    Stats printing: reduce the interim prints.

    Update documentation with new performance figures of both soko and soko2.


    Work down the below list and do the necessary checks before proceeding.

    In resolve.c, function search_forward_and_backward():
        cleanup
        balance between fw and bw
        Move content of search_forward_and_backward() back onto resolve()  ?

    Handle bingo from init_move_tree()
        Test bingo from the start position (called from init)
        Test bingo with just one forward move.
        Test bingo with just one backward move.
        Test bingo with just two moves (One forward and ove backward.)

    In position.c:
        Call find_reach_identifier() from find_or_add_reach() instead of find_or_add_position().

    Create file resolve-helper, and move in there;
        init_all_move_trees()
        init_move_tree()
        explore_for_reach()

    Create Got_it()
        Call it from regular as well as from init.
        Rename bingo back  got_it.
        stop.
        print.

    Try a few primitive real setups.

    solution:
        Should print OK when:
            1 forward move only
            1 backward move only
            0 moves (start posision == end position)

    Next:
        Create extra stop condition: program stops when 'no new move found'. (Forward and backward differ here.)


    Remove dead backward search trees.

    Prune dead branches.
    - Save time for subsequent tree walks
    - Could also be used to reuse the memory blocks.
    This is similar to pruning dead backward trees, but more difficult. It requires tracking of
    "no new moves found" at the move node level, rather than at the move root level.



    Keep track of distance, and replace existing moves by moves on the same level but with shorter distance, considering
    a setup a simple as:

            #####
        #####   #
        #.X oX  #
        #########       (setup-test 27)



    Add nogos for dead-end lanes:

            #####        #########
        ##### . #        #----  .#
        #----   #        #-###   #
        ####  O #        #    O  #
           #   X#        #.    XX
           ######        #########




    Document headers for functions. Might decrease heavy comments.

    Use more exit() calls and clean up code.
        At least do it for allocate_memory()

    Bring documentation up to date.

    Double check: Test for the maximum value of the index before returning a new tree memblock.

    Double check the conditions for new_hardnogos in the linescanner.

    Document why this impl uses indexed arrays and not pointers. (Jeopardising type safety.)

    Change and document file structure:
        - Create blockers.c
            Move define_hardnogos there.

    Print large setup: change to 3-digit numbers; similar to medium setup

Later:
    Find blockers in run time.
        Start with doubles:

            #X      Or:     #X
            #X              X#

        Next is squares.

            XX      Or:     #X
            XX              XX

    Compile with optimisation for speed.

    Malloc the playing grounds (instead of static 50*50.) ?
