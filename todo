Next:
    Keep Johnny up to date while walking the move tree?
    Pro: Know where Johnny is for extend_depth()
    Con: Does not match with take_back. . .
        Consider: Johnny a paramter to find_or_add_position(), instead of taking johnny from game_data.

    Change  t_direction  into  t_mv_dir

    Double check make dependencies

    Global:

        For walk_to_extend_depth():
            Add parameter search_dir to  descend, ascend, move_lateral & extend_depth.
            Update the warehouse from  decend, ascend, move_lateral & extend_depth.
            Write extend_depth
                Uses explore_for_reach
                Write add_moves

        Test by have a fisrt backward posiion tree available.

        Build backward

    Document headers for functions in position.c. Might decrease heavy comments.

    Use more exit() calls and clean up code.
        At least do it for allocate_memory()

    Rename bingo back to gotcha.

    Todo:
        Document latest changes
        Test for the maximum value of the index before returning a new tree memblock.
        Double check the dependencies.

    Return values of functions:
            A function primarily returns the intrinsic result.
            If an error conditon is a potential outcome:
                - Embed the errror condition in the function result
                - Where ever that is not feasible, use a sepate return variable for the error.



    Double check the conditions for new_hardnogos in the linescanner.

    Document why this impl uses indexed arrays and not pointers. (Jeopardising type safety.)

    Change and document file structure:
        - Create blockers.c
            Move define_hardnogos there.

    Print large setup: change to 3-digit numbers; similar to medium setup

Later:
    Find blockers in run time.
        Start with doubles:

            #X      Or:     #X
            #X              X#

        Next is squares.

            XX      Or:     #X
            XX              XX

    Compile with optimisation for speed.

    Malloc the playing grounds (instead of static 50*50.) ?
