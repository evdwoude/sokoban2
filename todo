Next:

    Use one move_path for both forward and backward.
    Indicate which by a single bit.

    Test find_or_add_transposition with johnny maniplations.

    Buld explore_for_reach_identifier()
        test the above again.

    Use more exit() calls and clean up code.

    Todo:
        Document latest changes
        Test for the maximum value of the index before returning a new tree memblock.
        Double check the dependencies.

    Return values of functions:
            A function primarily returns the intrinsic result.
            If an error conditon is a potential outcome:
                - Embed the errror condition in the function result
                - Where ever that is not feasible, use a sepate return variable for the error.

    Implement
        utility.c
            struct transposition_node *new_transposition_node(p_game_data_t p_game_data);

        transposition.c
            explore for identifier

            skbn_err add_transposition(p_game_data_t p_game_data, p_spot johnny)

    Double check the conditions fo new_hardnogos in the linescanner.

    Document latest new functions.

    Document why this impl uses indexed arrays and not pointers. (Violating type safety.)

    Change and document file structure:
        - Create prune.c
            Move define_hardnogos there.
        - Create explore.c and walk.c
        - If I choose that, then parhaps next_mark should move from util.c to explore.c
        - Create reset_mark, and use from next_mark

    Document: domain vs reach

    Print large setup: change to 3-digit numbers; similar to medium setup

    Function header for explore_for_reach()
    Create files for eplore functions and for walk functions

    Define movetree and tranposisiton tree data structures.
    Inplement add_transosition() for both search directions.
    Implement the forward walk_to_extend_depth

    From the guarding of the wrapping of next marker.
    -   Remove printfs and test loop.


Later:
    Find blockers in run time.
        Start with doubles:

            #X      Or:     #X
            #X              X#

        Next is squares.

            XX      Or:     #X
            XX              XX

    Try to generalise the code for Fw and BW search.
    If not: Separate fw and bw in separate files (Try using the same function names, with static.)

    Compile with optimisation for speed.

    Malloc the playing grounds (instead of static 50*50.)

    Add hardnogos / reduce transposition nodes:
    Add spots that can never be populated by a box because, a: it impossible to do so when it is
    adjecent to only walls and/or hardnogos, and b: there is no box on it as per setup.
