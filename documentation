Definitions:

    Johnny:
        The floor manager who is trying to move the boxes onto their target spots.

    Step:
        Refers to a game move where Johhny walks to an adjecent spot in the warehouse, without
        moving a box.

    Push:
        Refers to a game move where Johhny pushes a box to an adjecent spot in the warehouse.

    Pull:
        Refers to a search move where Johhny pulls a box to an adjecent spot in the warehouse.
        This is not a legal game move, but is used in the backward search.

    Move:
        Refers to either a Push or Pull.

    Direction:
        Refers to the direction of a Move. (I.e. within the warehouse; not in a search tree.)
        Values: up (north), down (south), left (west), right (east).

    Explore:
        Find all spots Johnny can reach without moving a box (or target), within the current posiion.

    Reach:
        The set of spots Johnny can reach without moving a box (or target), within the current posiion.

    Reach identifier:
        The lowest spot_number of a reach. This uniquely and reproducably identifies a that reach.

    Walk:
        Refers to traversing a move tree, in depth-first fashion.

    Box positioning
        The collection of the momentary positions of all boxes, or the collection of the momentary
        positions of all targets. The latter is used for backward search. (In backward search we're
        moving the targets.)

    Position:
        A positon is the momantary state of the wharehouse i.e. including the Box positioning as
        well as the momentary reach of Johnny. (The reach of Johnny is identied by a Reach identifier.)
        Moving a box (or a target) resuls in a different position.
        Moving Johhny within his current reach does not result in a different position, but
        repositioning Johhny into another reach does.

    Hardnogo:
        A spot can be regarded as a "no go" area (for a box, not for Johnny), when putting a box onto that
        spot immediately results in an irreversable situation from which the game can not be resolved.
        Spots that can be identified up front as no-go areas (so before any move has been made) can be
        considered "static" or "hard" no-go areas and these spots are marked as "hardnogo".
        (Note that a target can never be a hardnogo, as putting a box on it, even if creates a irreversable
        situation, it does not necessarily mean that the game is not resolvable.)

Approach:


    General

    The move tree:

    The position tree

        How the lookup tree works:

    Consider this setup:    ######
                            #.XO #
                            ######   (Spots are numbered from left to right: 0, 1, 2, 3).

        ... then ....


    (Later, we'll implement the store of postion as a hash, instead of a look-up binary tree)



Functions:

    explore_for_reach()

        Exploring the reach of johnny in the current position, meaning, find out what spots johnny can
        legally reach from his current position whithoug moving any boxes.
        The resulting spots are chained througt the eplore_reach_chain pointers that all spots have, starting
        from johnny's spot, ending with a NULL pointer.

        Notes:
        - The eplore_reach_chain pointers of the irrelevant spots are untouched.
        - The spot's reach_mark are use to mark the found spots while searching from more.
        - New found spots are deliberately chained at the end of the chain, not the current position.
        The latter would have been equally possible for the use of this funtion and would have saved
        the use of the end poiter, but this way the chain of spots is sorted for distance to johnny.
        This is useful for the third exploring-like function, ???(), and to keep the code
        similar, we choose to do that here as well.

        Legenda:
            N: Spot's neighbour pointer
            C: Spot's eplore_reach_chain pointer
            X: Any pointer value (either pointing to a spot or NULLL)
            0: Pointer value NULL

        In bother of the above scenarios, the assignments required to add the new neighnour to the
        chain are the same:

                end->eplore_reach_chain = neighbour;
                end                     = neighbour;
                end->eplore_reach_chain = NULL;

        Then, after Johnny advances to the next spot in the chain, the new scenario is again one of
        the above, and the handling can be repeated util all reachable spots are chained up and the
        chain-end is indicated with a NULL pounter

    explore funtions:

        explore_for_reach           Explore Johnny current reach and start trying to move boxes from there.

        find_reach_identifier       Find the lowest spot number within a reach, to be used as its identifier.
                                    It is used for two distict purposes:
                                    1. Together with the box arrangements, to uniquely identify positions.
                                    2. To identify different starting positions for backward search.
                                       We don't know where Johnny will end up in the final solution, so
                                       for every reach in the final solution's box arrangement, we have
                                       a different position from which to start a separate backward search.

        for_position                ???

        find_steps_between_moves    When bingo, we need to find the steps beteen the moves.

    walk funtions:

        walk_to_extend_depth

        find_move_path

    find_or_add_position
